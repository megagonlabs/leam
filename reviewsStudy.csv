tripadvisor_review_0###6###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"Also downstairs, there are 3 or 4 Ghirardelli chocolate cafe's and shops, which were fantastic."
tripadvisor_review_0###7###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"There are several restaurants as well as specialty shops at the Square, and it's only a short walk from the Fisherman's Wharf itself."
tripadvisor_review_0###8###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"Staff were fantastic, with the concierge doing everything he could to accommodate to our requests, from in-room dining, to arranging a in-residence masseuse for my wife."
tripadvisor_review_0###9###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"The Maserati town car was absolutely fantastic as well, as it took us to Union Square, shopping areas, or other restaurants that are a just a bit too far to walk to."

tripadvisor_review_1###0###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,Unsold timeshares being rented by the night at this point.

tripadvisor_review_1###4###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"Very convenient location - next door to Gary Danko, walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and cable cars, right on bus line (N. Point St.) to GG Park."
tripadvisor_review_1###5###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"Could be better: not exactly soundproof, as evidenced by the small child upstairs (who lets a little kid stay up until 1AM?)."
tripadvisor_review_1###6###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"If you want a foam pillow or other housekeeping service, ask them directly (seems to be a communications gap with the friendly kids at the front desk)."
tripadvisor_review_1###7###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"If you pay the hefty extra for a &quot; bay view&quot; room, be sure to get the 3rd or 4th floor - otherwise, your bay &quot; view&quot; is between the other buildings in Ghirardelli Square (and the people in those buildings look right back into your bedroom)."
tripadvisor_review_1###8###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,"Overall, not really a Fairmont but still a great place for a break, especially if you prefer self-catering."

tripadvisor_review_2###4###usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square,so when enough sold will cease to be hotel as well so stay - whilst you can.
