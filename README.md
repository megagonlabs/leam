# Leam
`Leam` is a research prototype for integrated visual text analytics that aims to combine the advantages of computational notebooks, spreadsheets, and visualization tools.

## System Archictecture

`Leam` backend features an in-memory dataframe, a versioning database, a compiler for translating visual text algebra (`vta`) commands that the execution engine runs, and a session manager to manage data, code, and visualizations. The following figure shows the overview of the `Leam` system architecture. The components with dashed borders ("--") are partially implemented and require further refinement.
